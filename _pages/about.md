## Bio
I am currently a 4th year PhD student at the University of Michigan studying [Statistics](https://lsa.umich.edu/stats) advised by [Ambuj Tewari](https://ambujtewari.github.io/). I graduated as a Math major from Princeton in 2018 with certificates in CS and Statistics/ML, where I worked with [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) on adversarial behaviors on blockchain networks. From 2018 to 2021, I worked as a computer vision/graphics engineer at Meta, where I worked on realtime dense 3D reconstruction (point clouds/KinectFusion) and dynamic real-time disocclusion on meshes. I previously worked on the software for the [Manifold camera](https://bkcabralwebsite.appspot.com/An-Integrated-6DoF-Video-Camera-and-System-Design.pdf), specifically adding support for rendering on cloud farms and improving the efficiency of the depth estimation algorithm. I also implemented, trained, and optimized (with layer fusion, SNPE, and QAT quantization) an end-to-end deep learning-based feature for Portal to run at realtime on the Snapdragon SoC. See my full resume [here](http://yashpatel5400.github.io/files/resume.pdf). 

## Research Interests
My research interests are in the use of robust machine learning predictions for making decisions downstream with probabilistic guarantees. Such ``predict-then-optimize'' problems naturally arise in many settings, such as in vehicle routing and model-based control. With machine learning predictions being increasingly leveraged in such multi-stage decision-making pipelines, I am very excited in studying both new robustification schemes, such as those extending conformal prediction, and the accompanying optimization algorithms to efficiently solve the resulting robust decision-making problems.

My current research interests are shifting to the subclass of problems in this space where the upstream prediction itself is a function, owing to the recent progress on neural operator learning for accelerating PDE solvers. I am very excited to explore the implications on robust control and related domains from this work. 

Earlier in my PhD, I explored alternative approaches for uncertainty quantification, focusing on variational inference, and its use in computational biology and astrophysics.
