## Quick links

- **Conformal Contextual Robust Optimization** — [Open page](contextual_robust_optimization/core.tex). Demonstrates how informative, non-convex uncertainty quantification from conformal prediction can be used for robust decision-making without excessive conservatism.

- **Conformal Prediction for Ensembles** — [Open page](conformal_prediction_for_ensembles/core.tex). Extends conformal prediction to ensemble or multi-view models via “vector score” functions and quantile envelopes for richer, distribution-free regions.
